## What is GMS Phixit?

**GMS Phixit** is a continuation of the [GMS Flags project](https://github.com/polodarb/GMS-Flags), designed to work with the new Google Play Services (GMS) database schema. The app allows you to view and modify feature flags in GMS and other Google apps, even after the original GMS Flags stopped working due to database changes.

- **Supports new DB schema** (Phixit-compatible, DB version 1033+)
- Root access required
- Fast flag search, add, and edit

## 🔧 Development & Build

### Debug APK Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow for building debug APKs with the following features:

- **Automatic builds** on push/PR to main branches
- **Manual approval** option for controlled builds
- **Comprehensive error handling** and build verification
- **Artifact upload** with detailed build summaries
- **Build caching** for faster subsequent builds

#### Manual Build with Approval

To trigger a build that requires manual approval:

1. Go to **Actions** → **Android Debug Build**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Check **"Require manual approval before build"**
4. The workflow will pause for approval before building

*Note: Manual approval requires setting up a 'production' environment. See [.github/ENVIRONMENTS.md](.github/ENVIRONMENTS.md) for setup instructions.*

#### Build Artifacts

Successful builds upload debug APKs as GitHub artifacts with:
- Unique naming: `debug-apk-{run_number}-{commit_sha}`
- 30-day retention
- Build verification and size reporting

## ⚠️ Why This App Is Currently Unusable
### ⚠️ ALL FLAGS RESET AFTER 24 HOURS

Any changes made to flags are automatically reverted by Google Play Services within 24 hours. This makes it impossible to use the app for persistent flag modifications. The app is released in hope that the community will find a workaround for this limitation.

## Why this project?

Google changed the internal structure of the GMS database, breaking compatibility with previous tools. GMS Phixit was created to restore this functionality for power users and developers.

The current progress is published in the hope that it will help other developers fully reverse-engineer the Phixit schema.

From our side, reverse engineering will most likely be paused — whether temporarily or permanently, we do not know yet.
